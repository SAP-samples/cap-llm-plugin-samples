# CAP LLM Plugin

CAP LLM Plugin helps developers create tailored Generative AI based CAP applications:

1. Without exposing confidential data to LLM by anonymizing sensitive data leveraging SAP HANA Cloud Data Anonymization.
2. Seamlessly generate vector embeddings via SAP AI Core.
3. Easily retrieve Chat Completion response via SAP AI Core.
4. Effortlessly perform similarity search via SAP HANA Cloud Vector engine.
5. Simplified single RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) retrieval method powered by SAP AI Core and SAP HANA Cloud Vector Engine.
6. Access the harmonized chat completion API of the SAP AI Core Orchestration service.

## üëâ Guidance : 
When to use the SAP Cloud SDK for AI vs. the CAP LLM Plugin?

| **SAP Cloud SDK for AI** | **CAP LLM Plugin** |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| [**SAP Cloud SDK for AI**](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/libraries-and-sdks) is the official SDK for SAP AI Core, generative AI hub, and orchestration. This is the recommended AI SDK for customers and partners. | [**CAP LLM Plugin**](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cap-llm-plugin-samples) is an open source community plugin for simplifying the development of SAP CAP applications. |
| - This SDK offers enterprise-grade integration with SAP AI Core and related GenAI platform services.<br>- Use this for all productive use cases requiring LLM access, chat completion, content filtering, grounding, data masking, orchestration, type safety, and business AI compliance.<br>- SDK has support for Java, JavaScript/TypeScript and Python.<br>- Fully endorsed and maintained by SAP for integration with SAP AI Core and related services. | - The plugin is not an official SAP product. It is released under the Apache 2.0 license and is published as a community contribution.<br>- Targeted for RAG-based CAP applications leveraging SAP HANA Cloud's [vector engine capabilities](https://help.sap.com/docs/hana-cloud-database/sap-hana-cloud-sap-hana-database-vector-engine-guide/introduction?locale=en-US) and [anonymization capabilities](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_PLATFORM/b3ee5778bc2e4a089d3299b82ec762a7/6cf9d55f4d3d45b0bcdb41756d86629f.html?locale=en-US) through annotations in SAP CAP applications.<br>- Supports Node.js and can be used for rapid prototyping of CAP-based RAG applications. |
