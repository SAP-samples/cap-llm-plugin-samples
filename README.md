# CAP LLM Plugin

CAP LLM Plugin helps developers create tailored Generative AI based CAP applications:

1. Without exposing confidential data to LLM by anonymizing sensitive data leveraging SAP HANA Cloud Data Anonymization.
2. Seamlessly generate vector embeddings via SAP AI Core.
3. Easily retrieve Chat Completion response via SAP AI Core.
4. Effortlessly perform similarity search via SAP HANA Cloud Vector engine.
5. Simplified single RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) retrieval method powered by SAP AI Core and SAP HANA Cloud Vector Engine.
